# GalacticImpactNeoVisualization Web App

This web app, developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, allows users to explore Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) within a dynamic solar system visualization. "GalacticImpactNeoVisualization" offers real-time data on NEOs and simulates their potential impacts on Earth. Leveraging NASA's data, the app provides a comprehensive and interactive view of NEOs and their interactions within the solar system.

## Key Features

- **Solar System Visualization**: Explore a fully interactive 3D representation of the solar system, complete with detailed NEO trajectories and planetary positions.
- **NEO Impact Simulations**: Visualize potential impacts of NEOs on Earth, offering users a simulation of various collision scenarios.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Access real-time information about NEOs, including their orbits, sizes, and proximity to Earth.
- **Interactive Interface**: Intuitive, user-friendly navigation through the solar system, suitable for both space enthusiasts and researchers.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: [React.js](https://react.dev/) for UI and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D solar system and NEO visualizations
- **Data Sources**: NASA's NEO database and other space-related APIs
- **Simulation**: Simulation are made possible with [Unity](https://play.unity.com/en).
- **Deployment**: Hosted on [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/), with continuous updates
